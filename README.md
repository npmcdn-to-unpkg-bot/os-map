## What is this
OS OpenSpace doesn't have the 1:25,000 mapping and the embeddable Bing client is a bit rubbish. So I thought I'd hook together some pre-existing stuff to make something a bit more appropriate for walking maps that isn't as rubbish as the bing client but still has the 1:25,000 mapping. It's mostly just me experimenting, there will be no technological breakthroughs here.

## Why does it use require.js
Because I wanted to learn about require. The page load time seems to increase significantly with require, so I'd probably remove it if wanted to use this code for something in production.
